# CNN-Cancer-Detection-Kaggle-mini-project
In today's world we are fortunate enough to have advanced technology which allows the medical field to provide better patient care. Cancer is a highly researched area because there are so many people who suffer and/or die of cancerous disease. This study aims to improve cancer detection in lymph nodes by using computer vision machine learning technqiues. We will examine the data given in this competition to get a better understanding of it. Then, we will run multiple convolutional neural network models with the intent to be able to classify cancerous (1) and non-cancerous cells (0). With improved and faster cancer detection, patients will be able to recieve life-saving treatments faster. This the first step in those peoples cancer survival story. This notebook covers the thought process as to how to create simple CNN models. We will create two models, one without hyperparameter tuning, and one with tuning. Finally, we will suggest ways to improve the models in future studies.

Layout for this notebook was given in assignment brief and is as follows:

1. Brief Description of the Problem and Data<br>
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Inspect, Visualize and Clean the Data<br>
3. Describe Model Architecture<br>
4. Results and Analysis<br>
5. Conclusion<br>
